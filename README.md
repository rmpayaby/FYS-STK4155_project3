# FYS-STK4155_project3

This repository contains neural network, KRR, and SVR-codes used in the project in src- and Codes_neural_net folder.

The processing of the data set can be found in test_script.ipynb.

Log-files after executing the conversion of the predicted data back to spatial data in order to create the maps in
GIS are also stored as well.

Predicted data sets for all three methods are also stored in the "Predicted_data_sets" folder. Latitude and longitude
of predicted data are also stored.

Due to the content of the original data set being strictly confidential, the original data set will 
not be posted here. Test runs are performed on the original data set, and the result can be found on
the test_runs folder. We recommend using one of Sklearns toy data set to test the code such as
load_diabetes. 

If there are any questions or any more information is needed regarding the original data sets and its features, send
an e-mail to rmbp@multiconsult.no.

Rhere might be a possibility to upload parts of the data sets under certain circumstances.
